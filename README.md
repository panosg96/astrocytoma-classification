# astrocytoma-classification

This program is developed in matlab and the goal is to classify a histopathological image of the brain, in order to detect the grade of a possible astrocytoma.
More specificaly, the user initially loads a histopathological image. The image goes through a pre-processing state in order to be prepared for the next steps. After applying certain functions in order to isolate the cell nuclei, the segmented image is ready and then the next step is to extract features. After extracting several morphological and texture features, the data is prepared and then the selection of features follows. The classifiers that are used are kNN (k=3), Probabilistic Neural Network and Bayesian Classifier. After getting a result from every classifier, the final result is created through a majority voting which states the final grade (High or Low)
